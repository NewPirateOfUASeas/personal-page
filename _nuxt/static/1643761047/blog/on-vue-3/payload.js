It's a technique that when you have this problem that you need, just like in Damien’s button example, there's a reason why a component that's props heavy becomes very difficult to maintain, because now you basically have to read documentation to use it. Why slots becomes an incredible asset and tool to solve a problem of too many props. Similarly, the composition API is not like, drop the options do composition.
