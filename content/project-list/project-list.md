# Here is the list of open-source projects i've developed myself

## Web-frotnend
1. [Hehex color picker](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Hehex-color-picker)
    * Tool to get hex colors with regex and edit given colors by shifting HSL.
    I used it to create my own [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) themes: [Diry-orange](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Dirty-orange-blender-theme), [Dark-violet](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Dark-violet-blender-theme). Don't get me wrong, most likely you won't be able to build a perfect theme with just this tool, but imho it's a good starting point.
    * Built with Vue 3 + Typescript
    * Testing automated with Jest
2. [Stop screencast Now](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/stop-screencast)
    * Just a prototype. This app (or I would say a component) is inspired by the khan academy component used in the JS course.
    * Built with Vue 3 + Typescript + highlight.js
    * Testing automated with Jest + Cypress
3. [Backgammon Vue](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/backgammon-vue)
    * Literally "short" version of widely-popular game backgammon. It doesen't feature online multiplayer.
    * Built with Vue 3
4. [EzFontStylingWithCSSnVue](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/EzFontStylingWithCSSnVue)
    * Just a simple tool i created to play around with font styles.
    * Built with Vue 3 + highlight.js
5. [Personal page](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/personal-page)
    * Yes, this is the page you are currently visiting.
